			"To promote a new season of fitness attire, lululemon wanted to have a unique online user experience. The brief was to build an online lifestyle magazine to engage with consumers, via interviews from their brand ambassadors and with a showcase of new season merchandise.",
			"I developed this online magazine autonomously. The development itself had to be compatible with a pre-existing template system, which presented limitations to coding capacities. I engineered solutions around these limitations, and the end result delivered intricate animation for desktop, with support for mobile devices; this was achieved through use of HTML, CSS and javascript in a local Node.js environment.",
			"The magazine was live between November 2014 and January 2015."
