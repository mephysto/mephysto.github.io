				<h2>Lululemon Athletica - Digital Magazine</h2>
				<p>To promote their clothing wear for the holiday season. Lululemon wanted to have a experience site with lifestyle and interviews with their brand ambassadors. The result is a digital magazine which I did the coding for. This had to be compatible in their template system which limited my coding freedom but still required me to deliver animations and support for mobile.</p>
				<p>For this project I did the all the front-end coding, and helped the team set up a local node.js environment. The magazine ran from November 2014 to January 2015</p>

				<h2>ECU Life Lessons</h2>
				<p>When <abbr title="Edith Cowan University">ECU</abbr> was in the process of updating their site to a new design, Longtail was tasked on creating a new landing page for future students. So we created a framework where we could 'hang in' future sites.</p>
				<p>For this project I was part of the concepting team, the Interaction Designer, and front-end developer.</p>

				<h2>HBF Amaze</h2>
				<p>HBF Health Insurance knows that everyone has the potential to be healthy and amazing, and they want to help every person in <abbr title="Western Australia">WA</abbr> to achieve that goal. So we built the world's first Facebook ‘AMAZE’ app to evaluate your personal Amaze score and let you compete and share it with the rest of the state.</p>
				<p>When a user connects to Facebook through the app, we looked at a range of data like the number of tagged photos, likes, friends, events, check-ins, even the frequency of certain key words. This data was then fed into our algorithm to create a personal Amaze score.</p>
				<p>I was part of the concepting team, I created the Interaction Design, and I created the front-end for this</p>
